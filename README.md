## What is Premia?
Premia is a peer-to-peer options exchange and settlement engine built for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
The protocol is designed to provide a set of smart contracts that advance open finance by prioritizing security,
self-custody, automatic execution without a trusted intermediary, and permission-less use of financial primitives.
